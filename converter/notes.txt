i imagine something like this roughtly

SYSTEM RUNNING - scheduled shutdown for xxx -> SYSTEM RUNNING 
SYSTEM RUNNING  - sudo power off/sudo shutdown now/sudo init 0/-> INITIATING SHUTDOWN - shutdown completed -> SYSTEM SHUTDOWN
SYSTEM RUNNING   - corrupt or unclean log file -> Forceful System Shutdown Detected

here's the data ive collected to create the system shutdown script

source : LOG
source_long : Systemd journal

1. for the trigger "scheduled shutdown : xxx", use this artifact, so filtering specific patter of  "COMMAND=/usr/sbin/shutdown -h" if suffice, then go extract the date from datetime, and sctract that hour after -h, put it in the trigger. the next state is just "System Running"
Systemd journal	reo [sudo  pid: 3131]      reo : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/reo/Desktop ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/sbin/shutdown -h 20:25

2.  for trigger "cmd : sudo power off", use this artifact, filterting "COMMAND=/usr/sbin/poweroff", if suffice then the okay, the next state is "Initiating Shutdown"
Systemd journal	reo [sudo  pid: 3099]      reo : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/reo/Desktop ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/sbin/poweroff

3.  for trigger "cmd : sudo shutdown now", use this artifact, filterting "COMMAND=/usr/sbin/shutdown now", if suffice then the okay, the next state is "Initiating Shutdown"
Systemd journal	reo [sudo  pid: 3158]      reo : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/reo/Desktop ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/sbin/shutdown now

4.  for trigger "cmd : sudo init 0", use this artifact, filterting "COMMAND=/usr/sbin/init 0", if suffice then the okay, the next state is "Initiating Shutdown"
Systemd journal	 [sudo] reo : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/reo/Desktop ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/sbin/init 0

5.  for trigger "shutdown completed", use this artifact, filterting "Journal stopped", if suffice then the okay, the next state is "System Shutdown"
Systemd journal	reo [systemd-journald  pid: 276] Journal stopped

6. for the last one, well its suppose to detect if a forcefull shutdown has occur, use this artifact, filterting "system.journal corrupted or uncleanly shut down", if suffice then the okay idk what's a good next state and trigger, suggest to me
Systemd journal	reo [systemd-journald  pid: 280] File /var/log/journal/6aef1e8dd4814dc4a1ed8dd0fcf60492/system.journal corrupted or uncleanly shut down  renaming and replacing.
